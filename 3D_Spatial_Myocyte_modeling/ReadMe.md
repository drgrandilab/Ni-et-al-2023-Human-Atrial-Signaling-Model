#### C++ code for 3D atrial cell model and adding static CaMKII effects

* No_Pacing_High_Na+: Cell not paced; CaMKII and Na+ levels set to high values (obtained @ 4Hz pacing in non-AF models with autophos-CaMKII)
* 2Hz_Pacing_High_Na+: Cell paced @ 2 Hz; CaMKII and Na+ levels set to high values (obtained @ 4Hz pacing in non-AF models with autophos-CaMKII)
